# Belly Button Diversity

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Roza. Robin would like to develop a website that will display the results of of cultures taken from participants'
belly buttons. The final dashboard will be able to display data on each individual's bacteria found inside their belly buttons. Ultimately, the 
participant will be able to navigate to their results and determine if their particular bacteria is needed to produce Improbable Beef's new synthetic beef.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to update the dashboard with charts that identify and provide information regarding the amount of certain bacteria
found in an individual's betty button. 

The final dashboard can be accessed at the link below.
